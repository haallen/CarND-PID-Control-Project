# CarND-Controls-PID
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

For this project, I implemented a PID controller in which the error between the current value of a parameter of interest and a desired value is calculated and a correction factor is applied to move the current value of the parameter of interest closer towards the desired value. For this project, the cross-track error (CTE), or the deviation of the vehicle from the center of the lane, is used to calculate the steering angle correction factor, which is then applied to minimize the (CTE).

The steering angle is given by the following formula:
Kp*p_error + Ki*i_error + Kd*d_error

where Kp* p_error is the proportional term, Ki* i_error is the integral term, and Kd* d_error is the derivative term. 

The proportional term causes the car the steer in proportion to the CTE. This term has the greatest effect on the car's overall position in the lane. If the proportional term is too large, then the car will steer too hard in one direction to correct for the CTE and then steer too hard back in the original direction, repeating until the car leaves the road. If this term is too small, then the car won't be able to navigate curves and other road features.

The integral term is related to systematic bias in the car that prevents the CTE from ever reaching zero. The most common cause of this is when the car is out of alignment. The integral term is proportional to the total CTE of the car. 

The derivative term controls the oscillations caused by the proporational term and provides stability to the vehicle. It is related to the derivative of the CTE. 

##Tuning
The parameters Kp, Kd, and Ki were manually tuned. The car didn't appear to have any bias pulling it one way or another when on a straight-away, so I set Ki to 0. Note: I also tried small values of Ki to confirm this decision. 

When tuning Kp and Kd, I first kept Kd at 0 and found the lowest value of Kp that kept the car pretty much on the road but had oscillations. I then increased Kd until the oscillations were damped enough to not make me motion sick.

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./pid`. 

Tips for setting up your environment can be found [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/23d376c7-0195-4276-bdf0-e02f1f3c665d)

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/e8235395-22dd-4b87-88e0-d108c5e5bbf4/concepts/6a4d8d42-6a04-4aa6-b284-1697c0fd6562)
for instructions and the project rubric.

## Hints!

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to we ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
